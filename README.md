# pizzapiStore
This is a nodeJS website that uses pizzapi to order dominos pizza!

### If you don't have Node
If you don't have node on your machine, first thing you should do is get the latest version here: https://nodejs.org/
Install it and make sure not to choose not to install the Node Package Manager (npm)

### Set up the site
Now that you have Node on you computer, you can download this repo on to your computer.
Go to the root directory of this project (the one with server.js in it) and run this command: npm install
This will install all the node-modules required for the site to run properly.
After that you can run either of the two following commands to start the server:

npm start
node server.js

Now that the server is running, go to localhost:3000 in your browser (3000 is the port I've hardcoded, feel free to use whatever number you like, just make sure to update in the code and the URL)

Note: At the current stage of this code, you **CANNOT** actually order pizza yet, but that will happen soon!
